# Firework Simulator v1 (OLD)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/MillerTime/pen/BVvPdB](https://codepen.io/MillerTime/pen/BVvPdB).

This is just a snapshot of v1 before I introduced some major changes. I'm keeping it for comparison only. If you haven't seen the new version, go [check it out!](https://codepen.io/MillerTime/pen/XgpNwb)

Fireworks fan here. This simulation of various firework effects offers variety and an attempt at realism.

Click or tap to shoot your own, and enjoy the show! Optimized for both desktop and mobile/touch use.  However, the larger shells (available from settings menu) are designed to take advantage of desktop hardware and screen real estate.

Finale mode is also available from the settings menu (top-right).

Desktop keyboard shortcuts:
P - pause
O - settings

Extra fun: slow motion can be triggered by dragging near the bottom of screen!
